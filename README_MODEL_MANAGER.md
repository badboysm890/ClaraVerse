## Model Recommendations

### For Beginners (Fast, Lower Quality)
- **TinyLlama-1.1B** - Very fast, good for testing
- **Qwen2-1.5B** - Small but capable
- **Phi-3-mini** - Microsoft's efficient small model

### For Balanced Performance
- **Llama-3.1-8B** - Good balance of speed and quality
- **Mistral-7B** - Excellent instruction following
- **CodeLlama-7B** - Great for coding tasks

### For High Quality (Slower)
- **Llama-3.1-70B** - Top-tier performance (requires lots of RAM)
- **Mixtral-8x7B** - Mixture of experts model
- **Yi-34B** - High-quality Chinese/English model

## Technical Details

### Storage Location
Downloaded models are stored in:
```
~/.clara/llama-models/
```

### Integration
- Models are automatically detected by llama-swap service
- Configuration is regenerated after downloads/deletions
- Models become available immediately in the llama-swap API

### Supported Formats
- **GGUF** format only (optimized for llama.cpp)
- Various quantization levels (Q4, Q5, Q8, F16, etc.)
- Models from any Hugging Face repository

### API Integration
Uses the official Hugging Face API:
- **Search**: `https://huggingface.co/api/models`
- **Download**: Direct file downloads from HF repositories
- **Filtering**: Automatic GGUF format detection

## Troubleshooting

### Search Not Working
- Check internet connection
- Ensure Hugging Face is accessible
- Try simpler search terms

### Download Fails
- Check available disk space
- Ensure network stability
- Verify the model file exists

### Model Not Appearing in llama-swap
- Check if the file downloaded completely
- Restart llama-swap service
- Manually regenerate config in Servers page

### Permission Issues
- Ensure write access to `~/.clara/` directory
- Check if antivirus is blocking file downloads
- Run Clara with appropriate permissions

## File Size Considerations

GGUF models can be large:
- **1B parameter models**: 1-2 GB
- **7B parameter models**: 4-8 GB  
- **13B parameter models**: 8-15 GB
- **70B parameter models**: 40-80 GB

Ensure you have sufficient disk space before downloading.

## Security Notes

- Downloads are direct from Hugging Face repositories
- Files are verified for GGUF format
- No executable code is downloaded
- All downloads go to sandboxed model directory

## Future Enhancements

- [x] Multiple downloads
- [ ] Model quantization options
- [ ] Model update notifications
- [ ] Custom repository support
- [ ] Model performance benchmarks
- [ ] Automatic model recommendations
